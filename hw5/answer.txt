problem 12.24

The functions in the RIO I/O packages are not explicitly reentrant since they 
have function arguments that are passed by reference. But if the calling
threads are careful enough to pass pointers to nonshared data, i.e., to avoid 
referencing the same variable for two or more threads, then these functions
can be reetrant. Thus, these functions are implicitly reentrant.
Since both explicitly reentrant and implicitly reentrant are include in 
the term reentrant, these functions are reentrant.
