A. Which registers hold program values x, n, result, and mask?
	%rdi holds x, %esi holds %esi, %rax holds results, and %rdx holds mask.

B. What are the initial values of result and mask?
	The initial value for result is 0,
	the initial value for mask is 1.

C. What is the test condition for mask?
	The test condition for mask is to test whether mask is nonzero:
	mask != 0

D. How does mask get updated?
	It is shifted  by the value of last 8 bits in n:
	mask = mask << n

E. How does result get updated?
	The result is updated by an OR operation with x&mask:
	result |= (x&mask)
