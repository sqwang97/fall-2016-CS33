A. No
   If x = INT_MIN and y = 0, x < y but -x will overflow to -1 
   since INT_MAX = -INT_MIN-1, thus -1< 0 and -x > -y does not hold.

B. Yes
   ((x+y)<<4)+y-x = (x+y)*2^4+y-x = (2^4-1)*x + (2^4+1)*y = 15*x + 17*y

C. Yes
   ~x+~y+1 = -x-1-y-1+1 = -(x+y)-1 = ~(x+y)

D. Yes
   Since the bit level operation of unsigned and signed arithmetic is the same.
   By converting both LHS and RHS unsigned, they are now interpreted in the
   same way with no difference. 

E. Yes
   (x>>2<<2) will yields a binary representation that has 0 as the last two digits
   and other digits are the same as x. Since no matter x is positive or negative, 
   the number with a smaller binary representation has a smaller value,
   so ((x>>2)<<2) <= x.
